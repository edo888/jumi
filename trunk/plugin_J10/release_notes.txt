Jumi content plugin for Joomla! 1.0.x and Mambo 4.5.x
Developer's web pages: http://jumi.vedeme.cz

================================
Version 1.2.0
Release date: 2008/03/25
Changes:
   - The concept of optional Default Absolute Path was introduced and implemented. It enables you easily include files from your server that are outside Joomla! (Mambo) installation directory. Thanks Rudolf Polzer at alientrap.org who notified me about this possibility.
   - New verification that included file exists and is readable. Thank to Fritz Elfert at fritz-elfer.de for this concept.
   - There is a just one demo -  jumi_demo.php - in the distribution package now. It is installed automatically to Joomla! (Mambo) "mambots" directory. You can run it immediately and delete it whenever you want.
Upgrade from the previous version
   - Just rewrite appropriate files - plugin_jumi.php, plugin_jumi.xml - on your server with the new ones.
================================
Remarks:
   - Upgrade your bookmarks too. Jumi has the new site http://jumi.vedeme.cz. You can find another extensions, manuals, demo, tips and trick, snippet there.
