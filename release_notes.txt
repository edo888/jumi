Jumi module for Joomla 1.5.x
Developer's web pages: http://jumi.vedeme.cz
================================
Version 1.2.0
Release date: 2008/03/25
Changes:
   - The concept of optional Default Absolute Path was introduced and implemented. It enables you easily include files from your server that are outside Joomla! installation directory. Thanks Rudolf Polzer at alientrap.org who notified me about this possibility.
   - New verification that included file exists and is readable. Thank to Fritz Elfert at fritz-elfer.de for this concept.
   - There is a just one demo -  jumi_demo.php - in the distribution package now. It is installed automatically to Joomla! "modules/mod_jumi" directory. You can run it immediately and delete it whenever you want.
Upgrade from the previous version:
   You have got two options:
   - Standard: uninstall the old version of Jumi module and install the new one OR
   - Simple: just rewrite modules/mod_jumi Joomla! directory with the content of the distribution package excluding this release_notes.txt.

Remarks:
   - Upgrade your bookmarks too. Jumi has the new site http://jumi.vedeme.cz. You can find another extensions, manuals, demo, tips and trick, snippet there.
